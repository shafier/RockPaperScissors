From the Odin Project on JavaScript Basics https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors.<br/>
The objective of the JavaScript Basics project is to build a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScripts.<br/>
<br/>
In the project, I learnt:<br/> 
* To use for loop.
* To use switch case.
* To use function declaration.
* To understand how the linkage works between the functions.
* To move up the code from my laptop to GitHub website and move down (copying from Respository).
<br/>
I got the game to work after spending **a lot of hours on it!**. <br/>
